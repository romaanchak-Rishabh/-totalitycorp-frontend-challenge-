# Apple.com Clone

Apple is a very renowed company and have one of the best homepage webpage for any company.
Here I've cloned the Apple website for 'totalitycorp-frontend-challenge'.



## Tech Stack Details

Here I've used HTML, CSS in the front and to give the website a little dynamic effect, JavaScript has been used.
The basic structure was made of HTML and was styled by CSS.

Since there was not much JavaScript, so the JavaScript was combined into the HTML page itself into
```bash
<script></script>
```
tag.


The Images used in the website was extracted by apple.com and the colors used in the site too.
## Approach


First the site was divided into smaller sections and were designed one by one, altogether for all the devices, that is, responsive.

Then merged the smaller pieces into a full fledged responsive websites and solved little bugs which were a hinderence to responsiveness and dynamicness of the website.
## Deployment

Since this is a basic front-end project, so to deploy this project, simply download the folder and run the HTML file on your live server.

To open the live website, it is uploaded on github pages.
